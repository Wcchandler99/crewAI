Ensure each animation is smooth and consistent with the character's design.\\n\\n2. **Platform Tilesets**:\\n - Different designs for static and dynamic platforms. Make sure the tiles can seamlessly connect to create continuous platforms.\\n\\n3. **Backgrounds**:\\n - Layered backgrounds to create depth, including sky, mountains, trees, etc. Ensure each layer is properly scaled to create a parallax effect.\\n\\n4. **Collectibles and Power-ups**:\\n - Icons or sprites for coins, power-ups, health packs, etc. Each collectible should be distinct and easily recognizable.\\n\\n5. **Enemies**:\\n - Various enemy sprites with different animations (idle, attacking, defeated). Make sure each enemy type is unique and their animations are fluid.\\n\\n6. **User Interface (UI) Elements**:\\n - Health bars, score counters, menus, buttons, and other HUD elements. These should be clear, visually appealing, and fit the overall theme of the game.\\n\\n### Example Art Images to Guide You\\n1. Character (Idle Animation):\\n - ![Character Idle](https://example.com/character_idle.png)\\n\\n2. Platform (Static):\\n - ![Static Platform](https://example.com/static_platform.png)\\n\\n3. Background (Layered):\\n - ![Background Layer](https://example.com/background_layer.png)\\n\\n4. Collectible (Coin):\\n - ![Coin](https://example.com/coin.png)\\n\\n5. Enemy (Idle Animation):\\n - ![Enemy Idle](https://example.com/enemy_idle.png)\\n\\nNote: The provided images are placeholders and should be replaced with actual art assets in your game development process. Ensure all assets are properly scaled and optimized for performance in the game.\\n\\n### Necessary Game Features for a 2D Platformer Game\\n1. **Character Movement Controls**:\\n   - Implement controls to move the character left, right, and jump. Ensure smooth and responsive controls.\\n\\n2. **Platforms**:\\n   - Create both static and dynamic platforms for the character to jump on. Ensure proper collision detection with platforms.\\n\\n3. **Game Mechanics**:\\n   - **Collision detection**: Ensure the character interacts correctly with platforms and other objects. Use a physics engine if necessary.\\n   - **Gravity**: Implement gravity to simulate realistic jumping and falling. Adjust gravity strength for a natural feel.\\n   - **Scrolling**: Implement background or level scrolling as the character moves. Ensure smooth scrolling to enhance the gameplay experience.\\n   - **Power-ups and collectibles**: Implement items that the character can collect to gain points, abilities, or power-ups. Ensure they are easily collectible and provide proper feedback to the player.\\n   - **Enemies**: Implement various types of enemies that the character must avoid or defeat. Ensure each enemy has unique behavior and animations.\\n   - **Levels**: Design different stages or levels with increasing difficulty. Include unique challenges and layouts for each level.\\n   - **Checkpoints**: Implement save points within levels to restart from after failing. Ensure they are placed strategically to balance difficulty.\\n   - **Health system**: Implement a health system to track the character's health or lives. Display health information on the UI.\\n\\n### Art Assets Integration\\nEnsure that all art assets created by the artist are properly integrated into the game. The assets include:\\n1. Character Sprite Sheets\\n   - Idle, walking, running, jumping, and falling animations.\\n\\n2. Platform Tilesets\\n   - Different designs for static and dynamic platforms.\\n\\n3. Backgrounds\\n   - Layered backgrounds to create depth, including sky, mountains, trees, etc.\\n\\n4. Collectibles and Power-ups\\n   - Icons or sprites for coins, power-ups, health packs, etc.\\n\\n5. Enemies\\n   - Various enemy sprites with different animations (idle, attacking, defeated).\\n\\n6. User Interface (UI) Elements\\n   - Health bars, score counters, menus, buttons, and other HUD elements.\\n\\nEnsure all assets are properly scaled and optimized for performance in the game.

      "\n",
      "1. **Character Sprite Sheets**:\n",
      "   - **Idle, Walking, Running, Jumping, and Falling Animations**:\n",
      "     - Import the sprite sheets into your game engine (e.g., Unity, Unreal Engine).\n",
      "     - Create animation clips by slicing the sprite sheets into individual frames.\n",
      "     - Set up animation controllers to switch between animations based on character state (e.g., idle, walking, running, jumping, falling).\n",
      "     - Ensure smooth transitions between animations for a fluid character movement experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Platform Tilesets**:\n",
      "   - **Static and Dynamic Platforms**:\n",
      "     - Import the platform tilesets into your game engine.\n",
      "     - Use a tilemap or level editor to design levels by placing platform tiles.\n",
      "     - For dynamic platforms, add motion scripts to create moving platforms (e.g., horizontal or vertical movement).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Backgrounds**:\n",
      "   - **Layered Background**:\n",
      "     - Import the layered background images into your game engine.\n",
      "     - Set up parallax scrolling by assigning different scroll speeds to each layer to create depth.\n",
      "     - Ensure proper scaling and positioning of each layer to fit the game scene.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Collectibles and Power-ups**:\n",
      "   - **Coin, Power-up, and Health Pack**:\n",
      "     - Import the collectible icons into your game engine.\n",
      "     - Place the collectibles at desired locations in the level.\n",
      "     - Add collision detection to trigger collection events and provide feedback to the player (e.g., sound effects, particle effects).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Enemies**:\n",
      "   - **Enemy Idle Animation**:\n",
      "     - Import the enemy sprite sheets into your game engine.\n",
      "     - Create animation clips for enemy states (e.g., idle, attacking, defeated).\n",
      "     - Set up enemy AI scripts to control enemy behavior and animations based on player interactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **User Interface (UI) Elements**:\n",
      "   - **Health Bar, Score Counter, Menu Buttons, and Other HUD Elements**:\n",
      "     - Import UI elements into your game engine.\n",
      "     - Design the UI layout with health bars, score counters, and menu buttons.\n",
      "     - Implement scripts to update UI elements based on game events (e.g., health changes, score updates).\n",
