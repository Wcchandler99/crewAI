      "\n",
      "1. Movement Mechanics:\n",
      "   - Implement left and right movement using the arrow keys.\n",
      "   - Include jumping mechanics to allow the character to jump over obstacles.\n",
      "   - Add gravity to simulate realistic movement.\n",

      "7. Player Experience:\n",
